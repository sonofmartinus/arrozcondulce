Arroz Con Dulce
Arroz con dulce, a beloved Puerto Rican dessert, is a creamy and comforting rice pudding. It's crafted with tender rice cooked in a fragrant blend of cinnamon, ginger, and other warm spices. Enriched with coconut milk, evaporated milk, and sugar, it boasts a rich and indulgent flavor. Raisins are often added for a touch of sweetness and texture. This versatile dessert can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature, and its thick, custardy consistency makes it a delightful treat to savor with a spoon or even with the hands.

Ingredients


    1½ cups rice
    4¼ cups coconut milk
    1½ teaspoons salt
    3 cinnamon sticks
    2 ounces ginger
    6 whole cloves
    Pinch of nutmeg-optional
    1½ cups sugar
    ½ cup raisins
    3/4 cup coconut milk reserve to use at the end

Instructions


    Wash rice and soak in water to cover, generously, for 2 hours. The rice will soak up the water so use plenty.
    About twenty minutes before rice is finished soaking combine the 4½ cups of coconut milk, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg in a medium size caldero.
    Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to moderate, cover and boil for 15 minutes.
    Drain rice thoroughly and add to caldero. Mix and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Reduce heat to low and cook unitl rice is completely dry, without stirring.
    Add the sugar and raisins, stir, and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Reduce heat to low and cook for another 15 minutes, without stirring.
    Add reserved 3/4 cup coconut milk and stir. Turn heat to moderate and boil for about 30 minutes, or until rice dries again. In this cooking period, turn rice over occasionally and scrape bottom of caldero.
    Remove spices. Spoon rice into a flat serving platter. Allow to cool at room temperature.
    This is served cold.
